# JsonapiForRails
A [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) 5+ plugin for providing a [JSONAPI v1.0](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/) API from your application with very little coding.

## Usage

### 1. Set up one API controller per model

Generate a controller for each model that will be accessible from your API. Controller names need to be the plural version of your model names.

```bash
$ # Go to the root directory of your existing Rails application
$ cd path/to/railsapp
$
$ # Generate your models
$ bin/rails generate model author
$ bin/rails generate model article
$
$ # Generate your API controllers
$ bin/rails generate controller authors
$ bin/rails generate controller articles
```

Then enable JSONAPI in a parent class of your API controllers. 

```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base # or ActionController::API

  # Enable JSONAPI
  acts_as_jsonapi_resources

  # ...
end
```

If only some of your controllers are JSONAPI controllers, then create a parent controller for only those controllers, and enable JSONAPI inside that controller rather than `ApplicationController`. 

```bash
$ cat > app/controllers/jsonapi_resources_controller.rb

class JsonapiResourcesController < ApplicationController
  acts_as_jsonapi_resources

  # ...
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/authors_controller.rb

# Change the API controller's parent class
class AuthorsController < JsonapiResourcesController
  # ...
end

# Do the same with ArticlesController
```

### 2. Configure your API controller routes
Update your application routes as follows:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # ...

  scope '/api/v1' do # Optional scoping

    [ # List your API controllers here
      :authors, :articles
    ].each do |resources_name|
      resources resources_name do
        controller resources_name do
          get     'relationships/:relationship', action: "relationship_show"
          patch   'relationships/:relationship', action: "relationship_update"
          post    'relationships/:relationship', action: "relationship_add"
          delete  'relationships/:relationship', action: "relationship_remove"
        end
      end
    end

  end

  # ...
end

```

### 3. Verify your setup
After populating your database and launching the built-in Rails server with the `bin/rails server` command, you can issue some HTTP requests to your API and verify the correctness of the responses.

```bash
$ # Get the list of articles
$ curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/articles'
{"data":[{"type":"articles","id":184578894},{"type":"articles","id":388548390},{"type":"articles","id":618037523},{"type":"articles","id":994552601}]}
$
$ # Get an article
$ curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/articles/184578894'
{"data":{"type":"articles","id":618037523,"attributes":{"title":"UK bank pay and bonuses in the spotlight as results season starts","content":"The pay deals handed to the bosses of Britainâ€™s biggest banks will be in focus ...","created_at":"2016-02-22T16:57:43.401Z","updated_at":"2016-02-22T16:57:43.401Z"},"relationships":{"author":{"data":{"type":"authors","id":1023487079}}}}}
$
$ # Get only the title of an article, include the author name
$ curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1/articles/184578894?filter%5Barticles%5D=title,author;include=author;filter%5Bauthors%5D=name'
{"data":{"type":"articles","id":618037523,"attributes":{"title":"UK bank pay and bonuses in the spotlight as results season starts"},"relationships":{"author":{"data":{"type":"authors","id":1023487079}}}},"include":[{"data":{"type":"authors","id":1023487079,"attributes":{"name":"..."},"relationships":{}}}]}

```

## Modifying the default API behaviour
By default, all API end-points are accessible to all clients, and all end-points behave the same way for all clients. In a real-world setting, you may want to restrict access to an end-point and/or change the behaviour of an end-point depending on the client. 

### Client authentication
Clients can be authenticated inside a `before_action` method in your API controller. Controller instance variable names starting with the `@jsonapi_` prefix are reserved by `jsonapi_for_rails`, so try to avoid those.

### Access control
Access control for authenticated and unauthenticated users can be implemented inside a `before_action` method in your API controller.

### Overriding an API end-point
The `bin/rails routes` command will show you the end-points that `jsonapi_for_rails` defines. In order to change the behaviour of an action, you can define an action with the same name inside an API controller. This does not mean that you will start from scratch, though. `jsonapi_for_rails` defines the `ActiveRecord::Base#to_jsonapi_hash` model instance method that returns a Hash that can serve as a starting point for implementing a `show` action.

## Implementation status
* [Inclusion of related resources](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-includes) is currently only implemented for resource requests that return a single resource. 
* [Sparse fieldsets](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) is currently only implemented for resource requests that return a single resource. 
* [Sorting](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-sorting) is currently unimplemented.
* [Pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination) is currently unimplemented.
* [Deleting resources](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#crud-deleting) is currently unimplemented.
* Test coverage is sparse.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jsonapi_for_rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install jsonapi_for_rails
```
